This data folder contains all the data files for the unit tests.
Files in the 'shared' directory of data are common enough that many unit test suites will use them, and not mutate them.

Specific files are put in a folder with the unit tests name for clarity.

I'll probaly have /output directories in this area as well, for files produced during the tests.
